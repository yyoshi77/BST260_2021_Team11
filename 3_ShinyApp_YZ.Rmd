    output$plot = renderPlot({

    # Identify which Olympics had a faster record by how many seconds, for each rank and gender
    output$diff = renderText({
        dat_diff <- dat %>% filter(sex == input$sex & rank == input$rank) 
        paste0("For rank ", input$rank, " in ",input$sex, "'s Marathon , ", ifelse(diff(dat_diff$time_sec)<0,  "the record in Tokyo 2020", "the record in Rio 2016"), " is ", abs(diff(dat_diff$time_sec)), " seconds faster")
    })
})
```


**Interpretation:**
From the interactive graphs, we can see that for both men and women, Tokyo 2020 Olympics seemed to have faster records overall. For men, the records in Rio are faster in high ranks between 1-16 and middle ranks between 30-40. For women, the records in Rio are faster only sparsely between the rank 30 and 50. In addition, we can see that the difference of time is more exaggerated in high ranks and low ranks, while the differences in the middle ranks are not too many.
